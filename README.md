Run npm start, then open http://localhost:8080 Or Run au run --open and it will launch application at http://localhost:8080.

This is a sample application being developed as a part of assessment test given by Hahn-Softwareentwicklung.

It can be used to capture basic applicant details such as name, family name, age, email, country and address and applicant's hiring status can be saved/updated as whether he/she is hired or not.

The top part of form is for capturing above mentioned details and bottom grid is for displaying those saved records with option of either updating a specific record or deleting a record completely.

If application user wants to save a record, then he/she has to enter all mandatory fields with required values/range of values and click on "Save Details" button. If he/she doesn't want to save that records, then simply press "Reset" button.

If application user wants to update any record, then he/she has to select that particular record from bottom grid, click on "Update" button and selected applicant details will be populated in top part fields, which he/she can update and again click on "Save Details" button to save updated records.

If application user wants to delete any record, then he/she has to select that particular record from bottom grid and click on "Delete" button, and selected applicant record will be deleted.

All these application actions, "Save Details", "Update" and "Delete" validates every record for its completeness as per application business logic and displays all required notification messages as a dialog with giving an option to user to whether continue with that action or cancel that action.

This is a simple application at this stage, but can be enhanced further by adding an option of uploading applicant photo, additional education and experience details; by adding a search option to search for applicants; by adding a reporting module which can generate various reports based on number of applicants applying per month, categorization of applicants based on country, education or experience etc.
